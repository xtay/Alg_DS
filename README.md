Alg_DS
======

I realized that many codes in C is not easily reuseable...

so I made up my mind to recode all of these stuffs in C++...in another project...

Algorithm and data structures in C

###In general###
this package is bunch of codes that implement some basic algorithms and data structures in our text book.
such as linkList and binaryTree.

###How to build and run###
the moment you just get these codes, simply excute
```
  $ make
```
and some simple test and run could be done by excute
```
  $ ./main
```

###files and directories###

**include**, all of the headers in this project are in this directory.

**alg**,  codes that implement the basic and core operations of some kind of alg or DS.

**tool**, some advanced operations or operatiosn which involved system interaction, and simple tests.

**testData**, data used to test and run.
